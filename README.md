# HeartDisease
This project intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.

We would like to discuss a little bit about:

•      Whose is more susceptible to heart disease men or women?

•      Is the Total cholesterol effect to increase the probability of susceptible CHD?

•      What is the most features effect to susceptible to heart disease?

Where we have more than 4,000 observations of 15 features, was taken from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.
