# Comparative study of ML model to predict heart disease
This project intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression. And find the most accuracy ML model for our data.

We would like to discuss a little bit about:

•      Whose is more susceptible to heart disease men or women?

•      Is the Total cholesterol effect to increase the probability of susceptible CHD?

•      Which is the most algorithm predict accurately?

Where we have more than 4,000 observations of 15 features,and we divided it into 5 categorical to be clearer. It was taken from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.
